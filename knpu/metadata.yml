title:  Mastering OAuth in PHP
price:  0
length: ~
summary: |
    OAuth: that mystical beast that you kind of understand and occasionally
    wrestle to integrate with some social media site. In this course, we'll
    dive deep into OAuth by building an app that authenticates with an OAuth
    server and show you all the details going on behind the scenes. You can
    take this and add OAuth authentication to any site you want.

    To sweeten the deal, we'll also show you how to make *your* website an
    OAuth server. That's both cool, and (if nothing else) a pretty cool way
    to truly master OAuth.
