Life On the Farm
================

But that's not all Brent can do with the API! Suddenly, Brent is jolted
from his dreaming to the sound of farmer Scott driving
his eggs to the market and screaming "Haha, Brent! My chickens lay way more
eggs than yours!" But in reality, Brent *knows* that his chickens are way
better egg-making hens than Scott's... but how to prove it?

Then it hits him! Fantasy Chicken League: a new website that Brent will build
that will keep track of *exactly* how many eggs come from each farm!
The COOP API defines a way to see how many eggs have
been collected from a farm each day. In Fantasy Chicken League, each farmer
will sign up, give FCL access to his COOP account, and then FCL will track
exactly how many eggs that farm is collecting. With FCL, Brent will finally be
king of the hipster chicken-farmers!

In this tutorial, we'll play the part of Brent, using OAuth first to gain
access to his account for a simple script that uses the COOP API to collect
his eggs. From there, we'll learn all about the most well-known OAuth grant type, Authorization Code,
and use it to allow farmers to authorize our Fantasy Chicken League website
to count their eggs.

We'll also learn about the Implicit grant type that's commonly used by JavaScript
and mobile apps, and of course more advanced things like handling refresh tokens.
With all this, we'll show some practical examples of leveraging our expertise
to connect with Facebook on the server-side and via its JavaScript SDK.

Ok, let's go farming!
