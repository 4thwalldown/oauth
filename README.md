OAuth2.0 - Episode 1
====================

Sir or madam,
Inside this fine repository, you'll find a few things:

1) client-start - This is the start version of Brent's TopClick website.
   If you're following along with the tutorial, then you want to start
   with this code. For more details on how to run the code, see the README.md
   file in that directory.

2) client - This is the finished version of the code that we build
   in this screencast for Brent's TopCluck website.
   For more details on how to run the code, see the README.md file in that
   directory.

3) server - This is the OAuth COOP server code used in this tutorial.

And as always, thanks so much for your support and letting us do what
we love!
